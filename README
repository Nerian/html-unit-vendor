# HTMLUnit Vendor

Do you need the binary files of HTMLUnit in your GIT project but you don't want to pollute your precious Repo with binary files?

Just add this repo as a sub-module

A one liner please!

``` bash 
There you go:

git submodule add git@github.com:Nerian/html-unit-vendor.git vendor/htmlunit
```

If you execute that command inside your project's directory it will add a folder named htmlunit inside the vendor folder and pull this repo's master branch into it.
